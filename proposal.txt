Project Overview:
My project would simulate a single ecosystem made up 
of predators, prey, and producers laid out as a 2d grid
of cell locations. Each 'tic' of discrete time would cause
the producers/plants to grow, herbivores to consume and reproduce, and 
predators to hunt and reproduce. Population counts would be tracked
per cell and simple migration between cells would be possible. 
The program would run with certain initial conditions and run for
at least 25 time periods. 
Implementation: 
I will use a std::map where each entry corresponds to a grid cell in the ecosystem. 
The map’s key would be a cell identifier with row/column values.
The value is the required nested structure (std::map<std::string, 
std::array<std::list<std::string>, 3>>)
each cell would contain an array of 3 lists (producer, consumer, predator) with 
each list contining tokens that represent population numbers
